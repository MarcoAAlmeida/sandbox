# GO LEARN

## Assumptions

Suppose we want to extract dependency information from a group of microservices.

 - microservices are primarily written in Java (and built by Gradle)
 - our exploration should be primarily in Go

## Topics

- write [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) config to deploy of a [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- use [protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) to generate our domain (Gradle Tooling API artifact model)
