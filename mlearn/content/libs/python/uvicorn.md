# Uvicorn

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server built on top of asyncio and httptools for Python web applications. ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a standard interface between asynchronous Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.

Uvicorn is designed to be highly performant and has support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, as well as WebSockets. It also includes features such as graceful shutdown, server push, and more.

Uvicorn is commonly used with frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, and Quart. It can be installed using pip:

```
pip install uvicorn
```
