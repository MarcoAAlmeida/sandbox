# Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

This recent paper ["Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) is definitely worth a read, as  we might have reached a breakthrough in Artificial General Intelligence.

> (AGI) refers to an AI system that can perform any intellectual task with at least the same level of proficiency as a human. AGI is contrasted with narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks. Achieving AGI is a long-term goal of AI research, and some researchers question whether it is possible.

## Pragmatic spatial awareness

This paper is a bombshell, but what first struck was this small prompt:

![stacking](/img/2303.12712_2.png)

I did confirm that chatGPT-3 has overconfidence about my balancing skills:

> Carefully stack the eggs on top of the nail, one at a time, making sure they are centered and balanced.

A stack of 9 eggs centered, and balanced on top of a nail, indeed. :icon{name="emojione:anxious-face-with-sweat"}

This led me to a quick [digression into generative art](/collab/digression)

## More to come

["Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) is a 154 page document.

I haven't had time to grok it yet, but I'll get back to you soon with more details soon.
