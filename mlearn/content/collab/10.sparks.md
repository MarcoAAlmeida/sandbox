# Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

This recent paper ["Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) is definitely worth a read, as  we might have reached a breakthrough in Artificial General Intelligence.

> (AGI) refers to an AI system that can perform any intellectual task with at least the same level of proficiency as a human. AGI is contrasted with narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks. Achieving AGI is a long-term goal of AI research, and some researchers question whether it is possible.

## Pragmatic spatial awareness

This paper is a bombshell, but what first struck was this small prompt:

![stacking](/img/2303.12712_2.png)

I did confirm that chatGPT-3 has overconfidence about my balancing skills:

> Carefully stack the eggs on top of the nail, one at a time, making sure they are centered and balanced.

A stack of 9 eggs centered, and balanced on top of a nail, indeed. :icon{name="emojione:anxious-face-with-sweat"}

Which oddly reminds me of the Middle Ages debate centered around the question of how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.

A prompt which yields:

![Angels on a pin](/img/2023-03-25-190625.png)

At least it's a pretty drawing (albeit pretty off mark too)

Well, this is only chatGPT-3, right?

## More to come

Sorry for the free association.

["Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) is a 154 page document, and I haven't had time to grok it yet. 

But I'll get back to you soon with more details.
