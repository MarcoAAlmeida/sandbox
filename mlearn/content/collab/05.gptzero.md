# GPTZero to avoid AI generated text

I tested [GPTZero](https://app.gptzero.me/app/welcome), and it made me wonder if it's not a futile attempt:

> GPTZero is a web app and service designed to detect whether a body of text has been written by a human or by an artificial intelligence. It was developed by Edward Tian, a 22-year-old undergraduate studying computer science at Princeton University, and a former software engineering intern at Microsoft1. #GPTZero #AI #plagiarism

> Perplexity is a measure of randomness of the input text that GPTZero will compare with how text from a language model would look like. The higher this score is, the more chances are that the text was written by a human and not by a machine1. #GPTZero #AI #plagiarism

It failed on its first attempt

And on its second attempt too, this time with a [response generated by chatGPT](/collab/harmless)

I wonder if these texts excerpts are too short, or if the metrics are not dependable.
