# LangChain Primer

This is my first article about LangChain, which is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

More than an API, the framework aims to:

- Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data [@see document loaders](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/indexing/document-loaders)

- Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment [@see agents](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/)

## Why Python Langchain


I'm choosing to study this framework, because at the moment of writing this, the project seems [to be quite influential and popular](https://snyk.io/advisor/python/langchain):

> The PyPI package langchain receives a total of 359,986 downloads a week. As such, we scored langchain popularity level to be Influential project.

A [feature comparison](https://langchain.com/features.html) shows that the Typescript library lags a bit behind Python.

# Quick start

If you're totally new to the subject, I recommend watching this presentation from [Greg Kamradt](https://twitter.com/GregKamradt) from [Data Independent - Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataIndependent).

It's a 40-minute video that will be worth your time.

## LangFlow

You can also check [Lagnflow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow), which is a simple UI for Langchain (written with FastAPI and React)
