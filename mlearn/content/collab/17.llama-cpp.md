# LLaMa

> LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a large language model (LLM) released by Meta AI in February 2023. A variety of model sizes were trained ranging from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters.
> [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA)


## Getting started with llama-cpp

this a quickstart based on [https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master)

```
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git

```

You'll need to create the environment, and install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Getting the models is out of the scope of this article.

## Converting the model

After downloading the files, I placed it on `LLaMa` folder, at the same level as the sandbox folder.

There are four sets of files, each corresponding to the number of parameters: 7B, 13B, 30B, 65B.  

Starting with 7B, which is a 12.5GB file named `consolidated.00.pth`Â´

> PTH is [a common extension used to save models for the pytorch library](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html).

These PTH files need to be converted to binary format before they can be used
