# Bing Chat behaving badly

[This video from Computerphile](https://youtu.be/jHwHPyWkShk) was recorded on March 3rd 2023, and it discusses an attack against Bing AI, which allegedly made it display its own set of rules

I'm sharing a section of the video where they speculate about the use of natural language to fine-tune and create ethical safeguards for a LLM model.

The reference to the "first rule of Fight Club" (last rule of Sidney) was funny, and insightful.  :icon{name="twemoji:smiling-face-with-sunglasses"}

It's fascinating how LLM can be programmed in natural language.  (which makes me wonder if [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#:~:text=Prompt%20engineering%20is%20a%20concept,of%20it%20being%20implicitly%20given.) is really a thing)

Other good points from the video: 
1. **internal AI sub-systems are probably being used to monitor conversations, identify issues and flag problematic responses**
2. we're bound to see more issues, because there's an AI race out there in AI market, and the major players (Microsoft, Google, AWS, IBM, you name it...) will be forced to make moves, and maybe release stuff which hasn't been properly tested yet 


## Computerphile Channel

I generally enjoy videos from [Computerphile Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile/featured)

I like the way they try to keep an academic, balanced and informative tone.

(the highlighted video about timezones is quite funny and real too, I also faced more than one issue with timezones and database ISO timestamps)
