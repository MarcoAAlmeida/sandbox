# :icon{name="logos:java" size="1.2em"} JDK 20 is out

Introducing several new features and enhancements to our beloved  programming language
1. changes to vector API 
2. scoped values for thread-safe data sharing
3. record patterns for data navigation
4. a foreign function and memory API for interoperability
5. virtual threads for concurrent application
6. new pattern matching for switch statements and expressions.



## Switch Pattern Matching new synxtax

Here's an example of pattern matching in switch statement:

```java[]
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Object obj = "Hello World";

    switch (obj) {
        case String s && s.length() > 5:
            System.out.println("Long string: " + s);
            break;
        case String s:
            System.out.println("String: " + s);
            break;
        case Integer i:
            System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("Unknown object: " + obj);
    }
}
```

## Vector API (incubator)

The Vector API, a new feature introduced in JDK 16 and currently in incubation, enables developers to express vector computations that can be compiled at runtime as optimal vector instructions on supported CPU architectures. By using the Vector API, developers can achieve performance superior to equivalent scalar computations.

> Incubation means subject to change, and its use is not recommended for production code at this time.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate the Vector API:

```java[]
import java.util.Arrays;
import jdk.incubator.vector.FloatVector;
import jdk.incubator.vector.VectorOperators;

public class VectorExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float[] a = new float[8];
    float[] b = new float[8];

    Arrays.fill(a, 1.0f);
    Arrays.fill(b, 2.0f);

    FloatVector va = FloatVector.fromArray(FloatVector.SPECIES_256, a, 0);
    FloatVector vb = FloatVector.fromArray(FloatVector.SPECIES_256, b, 0);

    FloatVector vc = va.add(vb);

    float[] c = new float[8];
    vc.intoArray(c, 0);

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(c));
  }
}

```

## Scoped Values (incubator)

Scoped values is an API that enables the sharing of immutable data within and across threads. Scoped values allow data to be shared safely and efficiently between components in a large program without resorting to method arguments. Scoped values are preferred to thread-local variables, particularly when using large numbers of virtual threads. The goals of scoped values include ease of use, comprehensibility, robustness, and performance.

Here is a code example that shows how scoped values can be used:

```java[]
import java.lang.invoke.VarHandle;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class ScopedValuesExample {
    private static final VarHandle scopedInt = VarHandle.create(
        VarHandle.typeOf(int.class), VarHandle.MemoryScope.PRIVATE);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set the scoped value for this thread
        scopedInt.set(Thread.currentThread(), 42);
        
        // Spawn a new thread
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            // Get the scoped value for this thread
            int value = (int) scopedInt.get(Thread.currentThread());
            System.out.println("Thread 2 value: " + value);
        });
        t.start();
        
        // Wait for the new thread to complete
        try {
            t.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        
        // Get the scoped value for this thread
        int value = (int) scopedInt.get(Thread.currentThread());
        System.out.println("Thread 1 value: " + value);
    }
}
```

In this example, VarHandle is used to create a scoped integer value. The value is set to 42 for the main thread, and then a new thread is spawned. In the new thread, the scoped value is retrieved and printed. Finally, the value is retrieved for the main thread and printed. Because the scoped value is shared between the two threads, the output of this program is:

```
Thread 2 value: 42
Thread 1 value: 42
```

## Record Patterns (preview)

Record Patterns is a new feature introduced in JDK 16. It allows developers to deconstruct records using patterns, making code more concise and readable. With record patterns, you can match a record against a pattern, and extract the relevant fields.

Here's an example:

```java[]
record Person(String name, int age) {}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person = new Person("John", 30);

    if (person instanceof Person p && p.age() > 18) {
        System.out.println(p.name() + " is an adult");
    }
}
```

## Foreign Function and Memory API (preview)

The Foreign Function and Memory API is a new feature introduced in JDK20 that provides a way for Java developers to call native functions and access native memory in a more flexible and efficient way. It allows developers to define and use foreign functions in Java code, and also provides a more direct and low-level access to native memory. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that require working with C or C++ libraries, as it simplifies the process of interfacing with native code.

## Virtual Threads (preview)

Virtual threads are lightweight threads in Java that can be executed in parallel without the overhead of creating a new operating system thread. They can improve the scalability and responsiveness of applications, especially those that involve I/O operations.

## Structured Concurrency (incubator)

Treats multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work, and features an API that simplifies multithreaded programming. It aims to streamline error handling and cancellation to improve reliability and enhance observability. The feature was previously incubated in JDK 19, and the only change made to it since then is an update to StructuredTaskScope to support the inheritance of scoped values by threads created in a task scope.
