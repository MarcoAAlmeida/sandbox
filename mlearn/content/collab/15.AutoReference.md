# Auto analysis

```
I'm writing a <PROMPT> for chatGPT.   I need your advice to make the prompt more effective.

If you notice any problems with it, please suggest corrections, or alternative forms to state the problem.

Give your own interpretation of the task, and tell me which parts were more confusing to understand.

What comes after <START OF THE PROMPT> should not be executed, just analyzed.

<START OF PROMPT>

# prompt here
