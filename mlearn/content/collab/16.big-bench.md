# Big Bench

[Big Bench Github](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench)

> The Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark (BIG-bench) is a *collaborative* benchmark intended to probe large language models and extrapolate their future capabilities.
The *more than 200* tasks included in BIG-bench are summarized by keyword [here](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/keywords_to_tasks.md#summary-table), and by task name [here](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/README.md). A paper introducing the benchmark, including evaluation results on large language models, is currently under review, and is available as a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615).
