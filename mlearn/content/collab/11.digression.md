# A Digression into AI art

As mentioned [another post](/collab/sparks), chatGPT has overconfidence about my balancing skills:

> Carefully stack the eggs on top of the nail, one at a time, making sure they are centered and balanced.

## Great Scholastic debate

That discussion oddly reminded me of the Middle Ages debate centered around the question of how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.

![DallE prompt](/img/2023-03-25-191335.png)

A prompt which DALLE (chatGPT3) yields as:

![Angels on a pin](/img/2023-03-25-190625.png)

Which is a pretty drawing (albeit pretty off mark too)

### Comparing responses

So let's use this benchmark prompt

```
Generate a medieval miniature depicting the "Great Scholastic Debate" of the Middle Ages, which centered around the question of how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. The miniature should depict two groups of theologians engaged in a heated debate, with one group arguing that an infinite number of angels could dance on the head of a pin
```
This is DALLE's response

The new [Bing AI Image creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) (which says it's powered by Dall-E too) responded like this:

![Dalle.bing](/img/2023-03-26-164943.png)

I think the Bing AI results were prettier than plain Dall-E, but it also came with a Bing logo at the bottom:

Tha little logo annoyance was not unexpected, coming from Microsoft.
