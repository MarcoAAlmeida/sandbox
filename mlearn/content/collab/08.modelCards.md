# Model Cards

> documents that provide information about machine learning models, including their intended use, performance, and limitations. They are designed to help developers, regulators, and users understand how a model works and what it can and cannot do.

Here are some examples of popular Model Cards:

- [Salesforce Research's Model Cards for AI Model Transparency](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/model-cards-for-ai-model-transparency/)
- [Google AI's Model Card Toolkit for Easier Model Transparency](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/introducing-model-card-toolkit-for.html)
- [NVIDIA's Enhancing AI Transparency and Ethical Considerations with Model Card++](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-ai-transparency-and-ethical-considerations-with-model-card/)
- [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)
